	<h1><i>Fears grow that massive debris from Chinese rocket could crash in populated parts of the US this weekend</i></h1>
	<p align="center"><h3>Concerns are growing that a Chinese space rocket's uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere could scatter debris across populated parts of the US.

        The Long March 5B booster is too large to burn up on entry and will break up, potentially showering the ground with chunks of metal speeding at terminal velocity.
        
        According to the Centre for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies (CORDS) "over 88% of the world's population lives under the re-entry's potential debris footprint".
        
        Experts at CORDS from the Aerospace Corporation have warned that as a "general rule of thumb... between 20-40% of the mass of a large object will reach the ground" depending on the object.
        
        In the case of the Long March booster, which weighs 23 metric tonnes, this means between 4.6 and 9.2 metric tonnes will hit the Earth - the equivalent of a dozen 1963 Volkswagen Beetle cars.
        
        In a Q&A on Aerospace Corporation's blog, the company said that the booster is one of the largest objects to re-enter Earth after reaching orbit.
        
        Most of the time rocket boosters are not designed to reach orbit, but to launch their payloads into orbit while landing in a safe spot.</h3></p>
